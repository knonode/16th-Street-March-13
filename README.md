## Concept

16th Street NW, Washington DC. March 13, 2025.

BLM Plaza lies destroyed under presidential order. A place once vital to the movement, now stripped of meaning.

Orange figures move across the pavement, methodically erasing letters. Sometimes they work together, sometimes alone—a balance between collective effort and independent action. They represent the systematic erasure that occurs under authoritarian regimes, the calculated destruction of words deemed dangerous.

But words resist destruction.

They return as yellow letters, growing from the black pavement like flowers pushing through cracks. When one word fully vanishes, another appears in its place. New combinations form—sometimes coherent, sometimes fragmented. The random damage and healing of individual letters creates an evolving lexicon.

This becomes a generative poem. The same orange figures that destroy words inadvertently create new ones through their movement.

The destroyer becomes the poet.
